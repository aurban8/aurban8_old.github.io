Summary: *California is the most popular state to appear as a Jeopardy answer. There is no relationship between the frequency of a state's appearance on Jeopardy and its dollar value. There doesn't seem to be an evolution with time of the popularity of states. Many plots are created here.*

[Last time]({filename}./jeopardy_1_intro_clean.md), I cleaned the [Jeopardy data set](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/) and created a JSON file to use for later. Well, later has arrived! Let's take a look at the dataset and look for some patterns.

I wouldn't say this is a super interesting result. But the good news is, I did learn how to make a lot of pretty plots. The [jupyter notebook for this blog post can be found on github](https://github.com/aurban8/aurban8.github.io/blob/dev/content/notebooks/jeopardy_2_states_values_years.ipynb). [Next time]({filename}./jeopardy_3_states_wikipedia.md) I'll look into other datasets which might give more insight on why certain states are more likely to appear compared to others.
