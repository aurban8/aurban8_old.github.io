Summary: *Wikipedia is used to trace popularity. Article word count does not correlate with Jeopardy popularity. However, wikipedia pages views do correlate with Jeopardy popularity. What's the difference between New York City and New York State?*

*Wikipedia is used to trace popularity. [Article word count does not correlate with Jeopardy popularity.](#Wikipedia-article-word-counts-don't-trace-Jeopardy-popularity.) However, [wikipedia pages views do correlate with Jeopardy popularity.](#Wikipedia-page-views-is-a-good-tracer-of-Jeopardy-popularity.) What's the difference between [New York City and New York State?](#New-York-City-or-New-York-State?)*

[Last time]({filename}./jeopardy_2_states_values.md), I explored the relationship between Jeopardy answers that were U.S. states and their values and appearance by year. I didn't find much of a relationship. Here, I want to investigate whether the frequency of a state's appearance is related to its *popularity*. I'm going to use wikipedia article word counts and wikipedia views as a way of quantifying popularity.

All the code in this blog post can be found in a [jupyter notebook on github](https://github.com/aurban8/aurban8.github.io/blob/dev/content/notebooks/jeopardy_3_states_wikipedia.ipynb){:target="_blank"}.In my [next post]({filename}./jeopardy_4_states_keywords_capitals.md) I'll look at keywords for the states.
