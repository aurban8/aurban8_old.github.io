*Here's a list of [keywords](#What-keywords-should-you-know-for-each-state?) you should know for each state on Jeopardy. Also, don't just recognize the [state capital](#State-the-capital.); be able to state it.*

[Previously]({filename}./jeopardy_3_states_wikipedia.md), I found that the popularity of a U.S. state on Jeopardy is related 
to its popularity on wikipedia. Next I want to explore the key ideas or *keywords* that a contestant should associate with each state.

That's all for now. If you have other ideas for how I can use the Jeopardy dataset, let me know in the comment section below.
