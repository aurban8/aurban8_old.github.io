Summary: About Me


### Hello World! I am Andrea Urban.

My first `hello world` program was written in BASIC, followed shortly after by a `hello world` program written in PASCAL. I learned the bulk of my programming skills after I wrote the following program in Fortran. Currently, I write code primarily in Python where I am continually delighted by its ease of use. 

```fortran
      program hello
          implicit none
          print(6,*) "Hello World!"
      end program hello
```



I live in the Pacific Northwest where I am surrounded by water, mountains, and tall, tall trees. I enjoy learning new things and working with others to solve interesting problems. I have worked as an astrophysicist at NASA, a science professor at a community college, and an online homework curriculum designer.
